AI Code Check is an automated tool for code analysis and review.

It uses machine learning algorithms and static analysis to evaluate code quality.

The tool identifies:

Style violations (e.g., improper formatting, naming conventions)

Potential bugs (e.g., unused variables, unreachable code)

Performance issues (e.g., inefficient loops, excessive memory usage)

Provides actionable feedback and suggestions to improve code quality.

Helps developers maintain clean, efficient, and maintainable code.

Supports integration with various programming languages and codebases.
